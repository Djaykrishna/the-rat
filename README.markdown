# Code for DC

## The Rat Hack

This is the Code for DC rats project. We are exploring data on rodent abatement complaints submitted to DC 311. The short-term goal is to visualize historical data on 311 calls and search for simple correlations with potential mechanisms for rat complaints. The long-term goal is to develop a model that can predict clusters of 311 rodent complaints in time and space, as an informative tool for city managers.
